    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This rich pasta toss is great for everyday dinners or special occasions. I can come home from work and throw this dish together in a half hour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh green peas</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced cooked ham</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
        <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
